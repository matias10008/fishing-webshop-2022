<div class="rod_component">
    <h3>A fishing rod is a long, elastic rod used by fishermen to catch fish by manipulating a line ending in a hook (formerly known as an angle, hence the term angling). 
        At its simplest form, a fishing rod is a straight stick or pole with a line attached to one end (as seen in traditional Tenkara fishing), but modern rods generally have the line stored on a reel mounted at the rod handle, 
        which controls the line retrieval, as well as line-guiding swivels (also known as rod guides) that reduce tangling. To better entice fish, bait or lures are dressed on the one or more hooks attached to the line, and a bite indicator is used, 
        some of which (e.g. quiver tip) might be incorporated as part of the rod itself.
